# Team Rocket Weekly Report - Week 4 - 21.05.2020

## Goals from last week

*  Sreepradh and Lokesh will be implementing the ability to add categories to birds. There will be six predefined categories as stated in the previous section, and the user should be given the option to add more.
*  Vasudev will work on implementing custom location and time selection while adding a bird sighting. As it is now, the device's location and time is used to auto-fill the fields and the user cannot edit those.
*  Rahul will be working on implementation of UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams.
*  We will have hopefully completed implementing all the essential features by the end of the next week. In the later weeks, we will test the app and move to adding necessary features according to the second phase.

## Progress this week

### Sreepradh

*  Worked on reseting map marker filters when going to the map screen from the bottom navigation bar.
*  Created a table to store default and user defined categories in the database.

### Vasudev

*  Worked on creating custom dialogs for location and date and time selection. Now the user can add bird sightings with custom locations and times instead of only showing the device location and time.
*  Built an APK file that includes features until 19.05.2020 and added the file to git.
*  Updated the README file to include information about the project structure and include a link to the APK file.
*  Created a merge request for the initial set of features to be merged into the master branch.

### Lokesh

* Created a UI to let the user select category and also to add any new categories.
* Worked on populating the database with default categories if the table is empty.

### Rahul

* Worked on and implemented UML class diagrams required for our project. 


## Plans for next week

*  Test and fix any bugs or small issues in the app.
*  Implement some smaller features such as validation while adding bird sighting, using a custom marker to show bird instead of the default, etc.
*  Start working on the blog and presentation ahead of the first milestone.

## Meeting agenda

* Demonstrate the working of the app, get feedback and suggestions, and make any changes if necessary.
* Discuss about the blog and presentation for the first milestone.
