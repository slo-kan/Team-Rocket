## Goals from last week.
Sreepradh and Lokesh will be implementing the ability to add categories to birds. There will be six predefined categories as stated in the previous section, and the user should be given the option to add more.
Vasudev will work on implementing custom location and time selection while adding a bird sighting. As it is now, the device's location and time is used to auto-fill the fields and the user cannot edit those.
Rahul will be working on implementation of UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams.
We will have hopefully completed implementing all the essential features by the end of the next week. In the later weeks, we will test the app and move to adding necessary features according to the second phase.
